# Australian Hydrogen Projects Interactive Map
This repository hosts an interactive map of hydrogen projects in Australia, showcasing the diversity and scale of efforts across the country.

## About the Dataset
The dataset features Australian hydrogen projects that are active in the development, construction, or operating phase, and meet renewable hydrogen or carbon capture and storage (CCS) hydrogen production methods outlined in Australia's National Hydrogen Strategy.

This dataset aims to provide a detailed snapshot of hydrogen activity across Australia. It includes:

- Location data
- Proponent details
- Descriptions for all hydrogen projects listed
- Energy source for hydrogen production
- Method of hydrogen production
- Amount of hydrogen to be produced per year

The dataset is the basis of the point-location map of active Australian hydrogen projects featured on the Australia Hydrogen Opportunities Tool (AusH2.ga.gov.au).

## About the Map
The interactive map was created using Python, pandas, and Folium. The map includes information on each project's location, proponents, operational status, electrolyser size, expected start dates, and project details.

## Getting Started
To view the map, download the HTML file and open it in a web browser. You can interact with the map to explore the hydrogen projects.
